# CHEERP WEBASSEMBLY TESTING APP

This is a lightweight [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) application for rapid testing (with auto-reload on code change) of the [Cheerp](https://leaningtech.com/cheerp/) C/C++ to WebAssembly compiler with C++ code examples.

## Why C++ compiling to WebAssembly (WASM) is needed?

* There are many C++ applications that analyze or process data. Porting such applications to WebAssembly allows running them on web browser clients and thus eventually reach the goals of massively scalable architecture and low-cost computing.
